    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Scarab Medical exists to bridge the gap between non-invasive consumer wearables and high-burden clinical monitoring. Our mission is to deliver small, durable, truly patient-friendly implantable sensors that detect early physiological deterioration — long before symptoms appear.</p>
    <p>By focusing on high-value biomarkers such as hemodynamics, metabolic stress indicators, infection biomarkers, and orthopedic healing signals, we aim to support clinicians with actionable insights that improve outcomes, reduce hospitalisations, and enable safer long-term monitoring.</p>
